## Introduction
This is my submission for MEHU1-hash algorithm, as part of 1st annual "Tiivistekilpailu" (Hashing competition), organized by AB MEHU Limited

## Fancy-sounding principles in this design
1. Design follows Merkle-DamgÃ¥rd construction, of iterating each block of data through all rounds individually
2. Application utilizes ideas from Feistel network, where each round is a function of the previous round
3. Design is based on SPN, Substitution-Permutation Network. Each round consists of subsitution, permutation and round key addition
4. The core inspiration for this masterpiece is based on the ADCS-principle of Kouvosto Telecom; Always Deliver Concrete Service

## Usage: 
```
ðŸ§ƒ [-d] [-r] [-f filename | data]

-d is debug mode, shows what's happening
-f reads input from a file. Without it, reads input data from command line
-r is random emoji generator mode. Use with seed data on the command line.
```

## Install:
Compiles at least with gcc on OSX: `gcc -o $'\360\237\247\203'.bin $'\360\237\247\203'.c`
